# Pathfinding Visualizer Project

## Overview

The Pathfinding Visualizer is an interactive tool designed to help users understand how different pathfinding algorithms work by visualizing the step-by-step process of finding the shortest path between two points on a grid. The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, offering an intuitive and educational experience for users interested in algorithms, particularly in the field of graph traversal and pathfinding.

## Features

- **Interactive Visualization**: Users can select from various pathfinding algorithms and watch the grid update in real-time as the algorithm searches for the shortest path.
  
- **Multiple Pathfinding Algorithms**: Includes popular algorithms such as Dijkstra's Algorithm, A* (A-Star) Search, and Breadth-First Search (BFS).
  
- **Obstacle Placement**: Users can place walls and weights on the grid to simulate real-world obstacles and see how the algorithms handle these challenges.
  
- **Customizable Grid**: Users can adjust the grid size, start and end points, and visualize the pathfinding process step-by-step.
  
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The tool is designed with a clean and responsive interface, making it easy to use on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the web page.
- **CSS**: Styling for the grid, nodes, and layout.
- **JavaScript**: Logic for implementing and visualizing the pathfinding algorithms.
